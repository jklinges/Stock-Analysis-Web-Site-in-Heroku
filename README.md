STOCK PRICE AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - Historical Performance of Five Similar Stocks
An Introduction to Analyzing a Comparative Stock using Data Visualizations and Machine Learning

Goal of the Project(s):
This a summary of a group project for the UNC-Chapel Hill Data Analytics Bootcamp.  See presentation here:  https://stanalysis.herokuapp.com/analysis

We gathered stock price data (of 6 aerospace stocks); all of which are large-cap U.S. equities). We gathered the appropriate historical data for a chosen (3 year) period ending 12/31/20 (Project 2a).
We then used various data coding methodologies to measure the relative performance of the chosen portfolio; against each other and an apppropriate large-cap equity market index (Project 2b).
We then plan to determine which machine learning techniques are best at predicting financial data (Project 2c).
Resources for the Project(s):
The languages and tools used so far in this project include:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Plotly.js
Bootstrap
Heroku
Python
BeautifulSoup
requests
MySQLdb
quandl
Matplotlib
pandas
MySQL
Project 2a: Gathering the Data
In this first step, we created a pipeline from our online data provider to our local MySQL database. We used BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape Yahoo for the ticker symbols of the Dow Jones Industrial Average/S&P500 stocks. We then queried our database for these symbols and used them with Quandl's API to download the historical pricing data for each symbol from 1/1/2000 to today. Finally, we queried our MySQL database for relevant stock data and converted it to a pandas DataFrame to use for further analysis.

Project 2c: Plotting Time Series Data with Plotly and Quandl's API
We specifically used a xxxxxx. Our code is here.

  
In the process, we made the following visualization.>here.

Ultimately, we decided to compare multivariate machine learning models like xxxxxxxx.
